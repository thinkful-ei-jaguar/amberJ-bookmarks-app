Find my app here: https://github.com/thinkful-ei-jaguar/amberJ-bookmarks-app/tree/gh-pages

Users can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

-title
-url link
-description
-rating (1-5)

Users can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
Users can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
Users can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

Users receive appropriate feedback when bookmarks can't be submitted

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
Users can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
